## Setup

<a href="https://github.com/emilemassie/MassieVFXOpenEncoder/releases"><b>[ DOWNLOAD HERE ]</b></a>
Thereâ€™s no need to go through a formal installation process. The encoder operates directly from the folder where the executable is located.

**To get started:**

1. Place the folder in any location you prefer. (For convenience, you might choose something like `C:/Massie_VFX_Open_Media_Encoder/`.)
2. Simply launch the executable to access the setup options.

### Customizing Profiles

You can customize or add new profiles by modifying the `Profiles` folder to better suit your workflow.

### Apply Settings

Once you're satisfied with the setup, click the green **Apply** button. This will update the Windows registry and create a MassieVFX submenu, as shown below:

Each option in the submenu will launch an FFMPEG terminal, encoding the selected file in the specified format.
