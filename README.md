#### THERE IS NO INSTALL !!! ALL THE CONTENT OF THE ENCODER REFERS TO THE FOLDER WHERE THE EXECUTABLE IS ! 
#### TO INSTALL, PUT THE FOLDER WHERE YOU WANT TO INSTALL (I like directly on the C drive myself : C:/MASSIE_VFX_OPEN_MEDIA_ENCODER/).

You can just launch the executable file to be prompted with the setup you want to apply.

The profile folder can also be tweaked to to add new profiles or to organise them better.

Once you are happy with the settings, press the green APPLY button to add the needed keys in the windows registery and add the MassieVFX submenu. It should look something like this.

Any of those option will then launch a proper FFMPEG terminal that encodes the file requested in the format requested!
